date,sentence,typical?(renovation) yes or no
2012-06-04,It ’s not the Shang pool or Capella Lodge but the towels 3 per person are laid out for you before you even get to your banana lounge and you are then plied with cool water fruit pieces in skewers and canapés or cookies with any drinks you order,
2012-06-04,The Long Bar is terrific but for my money and if you can eat early enough as it closes early the pool bar serves up a mean fish and chips along with the original Singapore Sling if you wish,
2012-06-11,On our last day we checked out at 12md and the hotel held our bags and we went shopping then back to Raffles for High Tea at 330pm having changed clothes in the pools changing rooms,
2012-07-02,My only complaint was the swimming pool and jacuzi area but having pointed out some constructive points I am sure they will attend to it in the fullness of time,
2012-07-29,The pool is on the 3rd floor roof and is quite busy its not a large pool area and is quite sun exposed so if you are after a tan improvement and some heat its pretty good,
2012-08-14,From the moment we entered the lobby we were transported to another world nothing was too much trouble for the receptionist who even though it was 100 am and check in was not until 20 pm escorted us to the lovely pool bar and ordered us complimentary Singapore Slings to start our day,
2012-08-29,as the swimming pool is located at the roof of third floor,
2012-08-29,come one Chinese speaking staff bring us to the swimming pool,
2012-08-29,When we call for asking where is the swimming pool,
2012-09-30,Also I think there where too many pidgeons by the pool,
2012-10-14,My only complaint is fighting with the pigeons for control of the hotel pool,
2012-10-14,On all four nights we stayed at the hotel we had the pool to ourselves in the evening,
2012-10-19,We also used the pool which is a little oasis in this bustling city,
2012-11-05,The pool is a rooftop guest only small area,
2012-12-05,Breaktast could be served to you in your room at your outdoor table or by the pool any of these options at no extra charge,
2012-12-09,I felt like I was at home although I do not have a spa or pool,
2013-01-12,Breakfast in the tiffin room cocktails in the writers bar gym small but adequate and roof top pool,
2013-01-25,This meant we had some time to explore this amazing city and also to pay a visit to the long bar and take a swim in the rooftop pool,
2013-02-25,Whether in the Long Bar throwing your nuts on the floor having afternoon tea or sitting by the roof top pool this is the best,
2013-03-22,We spent 4 days in december and were very disappointed by the hotel except the nice swimming pool,
2013-03-31,At the pool bar I think I had the worlds most expensive caeser salad over 25,
2013-03-31,It took forever to come out and there was no real polside service,
2013-04-08,The pool had very limited seating and had a couple high rise buildings peering into the otherwise secluded area but the polside service made up for it,
2013-05-14,A morning by the pool and being bought over an ice cold drink with a fruit dish unexpected but just another of a series of thoughtful gestures,
2013-06-16,The gym pool etc are not the best but the rest of the hotel makes up for it,
2013-06-19,The swimming pool area on the 3rd floor is small and felt tight,
2013-07-22,We were on the ground floor level which was ideal but the upper levels are more convenient if you want to get to the pool quickly and not worry about a flight of stairs,
2013-07-31,The pool is very nice but perhaps lacks the atmosphere of the rest of the hotel,
2013-08-01,During my course of stay I never visited the Pool or anywhere beyond the boundary of Tiffin Room for breakfast and the front desk,
2013-08-10,The pool was a little small but a minor complain would be that the pigeons would drink the pool water and even urinate or defecate into the water,
2013-08-10,Perhaps they can add more chlorine to the water so that it will discourage the pigeons from going near the pool,
2013-08-14,Pool area very pretty and relaxing in spite of the ongoing building works surrounding the hotel,
2013-08-14,From the room cleaners to the pool staff,
2013-08-17,We were able to get a late checkout at 2 pm and after that use the pool and facilities until 6 pm before our departure to the airport,
2013-08-23,You can have breakfast in your room at then restaurant or by the pool,
2013-08-23,There are 2 big jacuzis with the same temperature as the pool,
2013-08-23,The pool area was never crowded during my stay,
2013-08-23,The city suronding the hotel so you can hear the city up at the pool,
2013-08-23,The only thing that felt too expensive for what you got was the pool meny,
2013-08-26,On a final note there is a beautiful pool on the roof which I enjoyed at 7 am as the sole swimmer and as you looked around at the skyscrapers it felt like you were in a little time warp in the red tiled low rise hotel,
2013-09-01,We did hear the hotel swimming pool noise of water pipes etc but did not really bother us suite 230,
2013-09-05,Singapore Slings were mandatory of course however we found the ones served in the public areas were pre made with a couple of ingredients added fresh but the Hotel polside bar made them from scratch and did taste better still,
2013-09-09,Could not ascertain if it was a jacuzi pool as we did not walk towards the end,
2013-09-09,There was a smaller pool at the far end,
2013-09-09,The pool was smaller than what we expected however,
2013-09-09,As the hotel is only 3 storeys high you are above to see the Carlton Hotel from opposite the pool bar counter,
2013-09-09,We later proceeded to the third floor to check out the pool area,
2013-09-09,Before retiring for the day we took a dip in the icy waters of the hotel pool,
2013-09-21,At check in room was not ready yet and had courteous apologies and they offer to enjoy the pool until room is ready,
2013-10-06,Beer in the Long Bar before retiring and a cooling swim in the roof top pool to start the day added to our time at Raffles,
2013-11-05,After a tough day in city it was lovely to have a swim there,
2013-11-10,We stayed in a courtyard suite and whilst they could not grant us a checkout later than 12 they gave us full access to the spa pool and facilities until we left at 200 for our flight,
2013-11-27,Of course the Singapore Sling at the Long Bar is a must but do not overlook the Italian Restaurant in the courtyard and the pool bar on the roof,
2013-11-30,Thirdly and in my view the most concerning was the behaviour of the polside barman,
2013-11-30,On signing my polside bill the individual asked for an extra tip,
2013-12-07,While we prefer the Billiard room to the Long Bar eating peanuts and dumping the shells on the floor so you have to wade out from your seat is great fun and the Long Bar was always one of the “ must sees ” whenever family came to visit,
2013-12-18,Not exactly the birthday we had anticipatedWe thought to hell with it let ’s go to the other end of the expensive spectrum and booked in at the Marina Bay Sands 5 star Hotel yes the one with the famous high infinity pool,
2014-01-14,But the pool area is in serious need of renovation as is the gym,
2014-01-17,Small pool area but very well appointed,
2014-01-18,The pool area was very disappointing,
2014-01-30,Kids loved the beds 2 TVs in suite and swimming pool which was quite empty when we were there,
2014-02-08,Sadly no tigers in the pool room,
2014-02-14,The pool area I also thought is in dire need of refurbishment and upgrading,
2014-02-18,The pool bar staff were attentive and frequented changed your towels because they were wet or sweaty but did so while you swam or walked around so they never interfered,
2014-02-18,We even had a few hours to lay by the pool which was an oasis in the middle of Singapores bustling city,
2014-02-24,There is a delightful rooftop pool and bar area wonderful for late afternoon swimming although I was slightly concerned at the pigeons coming down to bathe at the side of the pool and drink the water no ill effects were experienced by me however,
2014-03-17,Only gripe lack of sun beds round the pool and pool staff unhelpful,
2014-03-23,We were also rather surprised when we went to look at the pool and gym to find that the spa desk was not manned,
2014-03-28,Bad things Eggs Benedict was totally rubishwifi in my room did not work for 80 of my staySwiming pool is disappointingly basic and average for such a high class place,
2014-03-28,There was a lot of noise externally due to local construction which rather spoiled lounging by the pool or strolling through the gardens but that s Singapore in constant flux,
2014-03-30,It was nice for once but matching my personal expectations some renewals at the pool new flat screen tv in the rooms etc would be necessary,
2014-03-30,The hotel has a pool on 2nd floor nothing spectacular,
2014-03-31,The number of sunbeds at the pool is too limited we needed to book to enjoy an afternoon there,
2014-04-01,The Pool is fine and Long enough for swimming but the water could be cleaner,
2014-05-05,Also the pool and gym were all small and disappointing,
2014-05-18,During a sudden rainstorm I saw hotel staff escorting swimmers from the pool to a covered area with umbrellas,
2014-05-18,Up to the pool small and pretty and surrounded by trees with red frangipanis she is greeted by name how DO they do this,
2014-05-18,She is hot and thinks a swim would be in order up on the 3rd floor roof,
2014-05-26,An example of how far the service goes a group of maintenance workers stopped working and opened doors for me to pass through to the pool,
2014-05-26,Only thing lacking was at the pool attendant did not get the water until we asked which was disappointing,
2014-06-27,Careful not to order a sandwich when you are by the pool or it will set you back around 50,
2014-07-07,the pool was not huge but we never had a problem getting a bed,
2014-07-20,The pool is worth special mention having seen the city an unfathomable amount of times in my life swimming while having it as a back drop is something else,
2014-07-21,The hotel is dwarfed by the procession of growing skyscrapers around it which makes and attention grabbing vista when you ’re in the roof top pool,
2014-08-05,With our flight not leaving until 630pm and check out at 120 it was delightful to be able to wander the Singapore streets once more then return to the hotel to have full use of the pool area and its shower rooms,
2014-08-07,Whilst the pool area may need some updating the staff team and food quality and variety are above most other hotels that one could ever choose,
2014-08-17,That said I was not there to watch TV I was there to make the best use of all the facilities and I did so from swimming in the rooftop pool a little run down and overlooked but still beautifully tranquil to having a masge in the spa wonderful experienceThe only real negative of the whole stay was that the hotel have recently decided to close the Long Bar Steakhouse on Tuesday nights,
2014-08-23,Few hotels in the world could match this kind of servicedo not forget to relax around the pool,
change point: ,going up,
2014-10-12,We spent 5 nights at Raffles and it was always with a sigh of relief I came back to the beautiful green gardens and exclusive pool at the end of the day,

2014-11-09,It really is an oasis in the city and you can keep entertained wandering around the historic building before cooling off in the pool,
2014-12-01,The roof top pool is surrounded by sky scrappers peering down enviably at the scattering of guests lounging between breakfast tiffin high tea and dinner,
2014-12-03,The Indian buffet was OKThe swimming pool is quite nice and staff there are very attentive,
