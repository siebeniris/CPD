I wasn't expecting much but had a very good experience at this property. I checked in at 5 PM after a quick flight from Ontario. The entrance to the hotel was a bit tough to figure out due a unique left hand turn lane. Parking was free and there were plenty of spots. The design of the entrance forces one to walk around the Porte Coche to enter if one parks in the front lot.The lobby entrance is very bright and relatively welcoming. The front desk is set up with two stations as one enters into the hotel. There is a little snack shop off the lobby as well as a computer station. The restaurant/bar is a few steps from the front desk and a straight shot from the entrance. I was checked in by the manager and my Starwood Perferred Guest card placed me on the fourth floor. This was the SPG floor, which surprised me, since I got my room at a significantly reduced rate. I was very pleased when I opened the door to my room. It was large and well appointed. The room had two extremely comfortable queen beds, a nice size desk, a flat screen tv, coffe maker, and good lighting. I appreciated the free wi-fi as well.The room does not have a refrigerator nor could the hotel accomodate that request. I am diabetic so I had to rely on an ice bucket to keep my insulin cool. The management should make note of this and buy some refrigerators. In addition, the room only had a shower and not a bath. The shower was large and had great water pressure, but I like taking baths so this was disappointing as well. On the upside, the bathroom amenities were of high quality and as were the towels. Noise was not much of an issue for me. The hotel is over the flight path from Sacramento Airport and I did hear occassionally hear planes but no car noise at all. I did not hear room doors slam or housekeeping in the morning. The hotel seemed pretty empty. Without any noise, I slept very, very well.There is a small gym on the first floor with reasonably nice aerobic equiptment that comes with small tv screens. Free weights were available as well to use. There were no towels to dry off the equipment and no staff ever came in to check. They have a small pool and whirlpool outside. It was way too cold and windy for my use, but it did look sufficient.I did eat dinner in the hotel. The food was mediocre at best and the service from the bartender was much to be desired. He was not customer friendly in any way and spent some of his time chatting on his cell phone. The sandwich I ordered was under ten dollars but I probably would drive somewhere to eat or bring something back to my room. The service made the dining experience pathetic and the food isnt worth being treated unattentively. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel but did notice it was over ten dollars to eat at their buffet. On a plus side the hotel is close to the airport and to downtown. One needs a car to get downtown but its very close. They offer shuttle service to the airport. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. I am not sure I would want to pay rack rates for this property, which I have seen as high as $170.00 but I would stay here again at the discounted rate I got this hotel for. I think its a find in the Natomas area, and only hope more stores/restaurants will be built to offer guests more choices and options for dining.In addition, I hope the management of this property reads tripadvisor.com and gets rid of the unfriendly bartender and buys some mini-fridges for guests."]}, {"93cd60d5-48c6-4bb5-9f42-59c9f8c4f56a": ["2007-11-04 00:00:00", "2012-10-09 07:19:30", 100, 40.0, null, "en", "Sacramento's Worst Breakfast...", "This was my first stay at a Four Points, as I have always liked staying at Sheraton, I figured this would be a good budget version. I guess I figured wrong. This is a brand new property and it seems to have a few quirks to work out. The rooms were good size but featured a noisy air conditioner window unit that came on and off about every fifteen minutes, this accompanied by the road construction outside made for a restless night. The bathroom door would not stay closed, but this turned out to a blessing, as the automatic lights would turn on and off while you were in the shower, or tending to other business.The hotel chain also prides itself on great tasting pie. Apple pie scent is piped in throughout the hotel, and pie placards are placed in the room enticing you to eat pie. There was just one problem. Pie was not even on the room service menu. And there was no pie to be found downstairs either. Speaking of the downstairs restaurant, no where in Central California has a more un-appetizing breakfast buffet. Everything in the warming plates was old, dried out and cold. The selection of cereals was great, but the hotel was out of milk. The made to order eggs even managed to come out cold and dry. Complaints on the food fell on deaf ears, and in fact ordering anything from the server was an experience as it had to be repeated twice in order for her to understand. All this for a low price of $13 per person. My advice, go down the street to Ikea, order the $1.99 bacon and egg breakfast which comes with free coffee, you'll be much happier. We were. No one in the hotel asked if everything was ok, or seemed to care.

It's located in Natomas area of Sacramento and close to many chain restaurants and fast food places.I stayed here twice and both times I used Hotwire to purchase my room at a much lower rate than what you would pay here normally. The first time they gave me room 414 which is right next to the elevator and the Ice machine is against your wall which makes for a noisy room. The 2nd time they gave me room 213 also right next to the elevator. When I asked for another room since the room they gave me had two beds, they gave me 203 (again next to the elevator). I suspect they are giving me the least desirable rooms since I booked on Hotwire. I have heard of hotels doing this sort of thing.The rooms do not have a chest of drawers, they have this odd storage area with bins in them...I guess someone must have thought its cool. The TV is a 32 inch LCD (not the typical 42\" you find in hotels of this price range)...and does not have an external HDMI input...it has other inputs however.Some of the rooms have bathtubs and some have stand up showers. The lights in the rooms are all the fluorescent type which by itself may be OK if the lamp shades were not also white...the result is a very garish lighting experience which gave me a headache.

Bathroom:  It seemed to be a room for people with disabilities, yet the toilet did not appear to be as such - low and no handrails on the wall.  You couldn't close the shower door with a handle, the hot and cold were switched on the sink handles, the toilet would not flush well.  At the hottest, the water temp was only tepid in both sink and shower.  This was at 8:00pm, so didn't make sense. Staff:  They seemed new.  No concierge service and asking about whether a nearby gas station was open 24 hours for refills on rentals seemed to be a foreign question to the staff on duty.  Though, he did call to find out after being asked to do so.  Given it is advertised as an Airport Hotel and seemed to cater to business travelers, this should be a given.  That said, the overnight staff was fabulous - offering fresh coffee at 3:45am in the lobby.  Though, was that fruit also available for free?  Hard to know.  The continental items seemed intermixed with obvious sale items so I just didn't even ask. Plus, overnight staff immediately made note of the mixed up hot and cold knobs in the bathroom sink when mentioned - I suspect that is already fixed given her attention to the matter.  She was very attentive and friendly even at that hour and gets my biggest kudos for that. Generally:  The room was very large and roomy, but soooo noisy.  Do NOT stay there if you want to sleep and arise very early for a flight out.  The room shook and echoed with the noise overhead and woke me up at 1:00am just from someone walking across above.  TVs in other rooms were heard clearly. There was a strange smell upon entering, but you get used to it quick and don't notice it.  Pillows were very comfortable, bed was mediocre. Can this place be great?  Yes.  But it's going to take some growing pains to get there.  It's not great out of the box.

Staff was all very nice. I greatly appreciated the free drink given to Gold SPG members.

Not enough in-room coffee for two people; if you're going to put it there, assume there's a couple.The $11 breakfast has a buffet and made-to-order omelets; the buffet looked stagnant, so I opted for a ham and cheese omelet. They brought the omelet to me with the cheese unmelted; even the inside cheese was still solid. I sent it back and asked that the cheese be melted, as required but the word \"omelet\". It came back with melted cheese, but was completely inedible; I had one bite and spat it out because it was grainy. (What made it grainy, I have no idea. My colleague's omelet was simply cheese and egg, and even that was gross. How do you mess up an omelet?!) When I checked out, I spoke to the manager (Jeff) about the horrendous omelet, and he graciously offered to make one for me himself. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to wait for that. I wish he would have offered to comp BF; I basically paid $11 for cereal and coffee. Thank goodness for the Clif bar in my bag.I would give it 4 stars if they had edible breakfast.

I love it that this hotel is 100% smoke free, and since it is a newer hotel, obviously it has never been smoked in, and that is wonderful! Sometimes on older hotels that have \"non smoking rooms\" you can tell that for years in the past that smoking was allowed, because there is a lingering smell. This hotel had zero smoke smell. Awesome!! However, there was a funny smell in the lobby. I suppose it smelled like some cleaning product, but it would be nice if they could use some sort of air freshener. But here's my biggest beef. This is the second time I've used Priceline \"name your price\" for a hotel room (the first time I used it was not for this hotel) an the first room they gave me was terrible! Last month, when I used the \"name your own price\" and got a terrible room (it was another hotel chain in San Jose), I thought was a fluke. But now this is the second time, and I STIll got a terrible room! I guess hotels think that since the person is \"cheap\" enough to try and get a cheap room, that they don't deserve a nice room, I don't know. I don't understand these hotels that give you their worst room just because I got it for significantly below rack rate. I mean, they accepted the price! If they don't like how cheap people get the rooms, then don't participate in Priceline. What hotels don't seem to understand is that by giving a guest a good experience, even if they got it for a cheap price, that guest will be back. Maybe they don't want guests back who are always looking for a bargain. I don't know. I just don't understand it.However, the front desk readily changed my room when I asked. The good news was that I hadn't unpacked, because after my first experience with the hotel in San Jose, CA where I got an awful room, I went around and checked everything in the room they gave me. The first thing I did was check all the lamps. I found that the bedside lamp on the side of the bed I like to sleep in was burned out. I changed bulbs with the lamp on the other side of the bed, to see if that was the problem, but that didn't help. Then I noticed that the clock radio which was plugged into the same outlet didn't work either, so I figured that the outlet wasn't working. I contacted the front desk and asked them to send someone to look at it. I told her what I'd done and that it wasn't the bulb. Since the room they'd given me was on the ground floor, I just walked over to the front desk and told her this in person. She said she'd send someone out to look at it, but I could tell that she thought that it wasn't going to be able to be fixed by maintenance, since it wasn't simply a burned out bulb. I went back to my room to wait for maintenance. Then I noticed that, even though I'd been in the room for 10 minutes, it wasn't any cooler than when I walked in. I lowered the temp on the AC and waited, then felt the air that was blowing out, and it was warm. The hotel room they gave me was on the west side of the hotel, and this was late in the afternoon, so the sun was beating down on the window. It was probably over 80 degrees in the room. That's when I decided forget it, I want a new room.I walked back out to the front desk, and told her about the AC, and asked for a new room. She didn't even hesitate. She gave me a nice room on the 2nd floor, and everything worked, including the AC and the bedside lamp. Yay! The room was nice, spacious and clean. But the beds, advertised as \"\u2022Four Points by Sheraton Four Comfort Bed\" wasn't comfortable at all. It was no better, no different than most hotel beds, which to me are almost always hard and uncomfortable. Overall, it was a great hotel, very convenient to the airport, and restaurants were a short drive away. However, if you've flown in and used the shuttle to get to the hotel, be aware there are no restaurants within walking distance. However, the hotel does have a restaurant and bar, so you won't starve. :)The one thing I want to say to hotels out there, is if you're going to participate in \"name your own price\" by Priceline, don't give these guests the crappy room. It isn't very classy and doesn't make people want to come back. I do appreciate very much that this hotel made it right, but this should never have happened in the first place."]}, {"d57140d1-69cd-46f7-9020-639560c90f39": ["2012-08-12 00:00:00", "2013-03-11 07:24:16", 100, 80.0, null, "en", "Best Part of Trip", "We fly out of Sacramento Airport occasionally.

I checked in, made sure I was getting a room with a bathtub, got the SPG floor (nice!), and brought my 50lbs of backpack up to the room. Lay down, then go to the bathroom...no bath. How annoying! So I assumed it was a mistake and took my stuff to the front desk to inquire about 10 minutes after my initial check in. A seemingly nice guy told me immediately after asking about the bath that there was not a room available with a bath, despite what I was told on the phone. So I mentioned that when I called, I was told that it wouldn't be an issue. He then told me that he could check to see if there were any rooms with a bath available (didn't check the first time I asked, why?). He checked and said that there was a room with a bath available (go figure...) next door to my original room. Okay, great! So I thank him and head back up to the top floor with my bag for the second time. Get into the new room and...NO BATHTUB! WHAT! I didn't do anything after this. I'm not the type to complain about minor things. It wouldn't have been a big deal if they had said there were no rooms with baths when I called originally. It wouldn't have been a big deal if they said when I arrived that they were sorry but there was no room with a bath. And it wouldn't have been a big deal to get an apology and say there were no rooms with baths available after I had gone into my bathtub-less room. It was a pretty annoying experience going back and forth and being told several times that I was getting a room with a bathtub only to be left empty handed at the end of a rather annoying experience. The only thing that would make me laugh would be to be told that this hotel did not have rooms with bathtubs at all. Also, the USB plug on the desk did not work. I would recommend this place because of its cleanliness, the state of the rooms, and its location. And the shower was really nice with the sliding glass door (which I would have preferred 99% of the time over a bathtub). Come for all that good stuff, but don't expect much from the staff."]}, {"1d5837ad-844f-4abd-94cf-ce077e4cd7ab": ["2012-10-01 00:00:00", "2014-03-18 18:25:35", 100, 100.0, null, null, null, ""]}, {"c3b9afa0-bb31-4ea1-a944-adb24265fe49": ["2012-12-01 00:00:00", "2014-03-18 18:25:35", 100, 80.0, null, null, null, ""]}, {"882277c8-ff30-410e-9f92-fdfd6141f067": ["2012-11-01 00:00:00", "2014-03-18 18:25:35", 100, 60.0, null, null, null, ""]}, {"fcaccd86-d867-422f-99b5-59d44da4c699": ["2012-11-27 00:00:00", "2016-01-18 02:42:47", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "Very clean and comfortable.", "this hotel was close to I-5, close to airport and the arena. very clean and friendly.

More disconcerting, however, was that we got the sense the room wasn't totally cleaned. The toilet seat was up when we walked in - unusual for a hotel. The coffee/water was only half stocked.

We stayed here one other time prior to flying out the Sacramento Airport and it was a decent hotel at a good price, so I was pleased when we won it on Priceline. We checked in the evening of 4/16 and were getting ready for a dinner reservation. The iron in our room was broken so we called to the front desk and requested a new one. Told them we only had an hour to get ready and never received a new iron. Went to dinner in wrinkly clothes. Returned to the hotel at 11PM and a wedding was occurring in the pavillion. For some reason there were police officers present and that should have been our first warning. Since the pavillion is separated from the hotel we were not too concerned. We went to bed around midnight and were awoken to a party IN THE HALLWAY outside our room. I opened the door to see what was going on and there were 20-30 younger adults drinking and carrying on in the hallway. I called the front desk (how they were not aware is beyond me since we were on the 2nd floor). A few moments later we hear a hotel employee yelling at them to back to their rooms. A verbal exchange occurs, the drunk guests scream profanities at the employee. The employee leaves and the party ensues. A second female employee attempts to get them to their rooms, with no luck. They remained in the hallway until 3AM, then went to their rooms and drank and carried on until 6AM. Pot smoke wafted into our room via the vents. We got no sleep. The walls in this hotel are paper thin. We also had the pleasure of hearing a baby cry on the other side of us for most of the night. The next morning I call the front desk and ask to speak to a manager. I am told he will be in around 9AM. He never calls. We check out at 10AM and ask to speak to a manager again and are told he didn't come in that day. I LOVE being LIED to by employees. The rather apathetic and completely unapologetic front desk staff take my number and tell me a manager will call. That was 10 days ago and no phone call yet. I cannot believe a hotel would allow this! Call the police, eject unruly hotel guests. To allow them to stay and ruin the entire second floors night of sleep is unacceptable."]}, {"df7f021c-20c5-4e10-a4bd-8a696ac2f840": ["2011-04-30 00:00:00", "2012-10-09 07:19:30", 100, 40.0, null, "en", "As if I'd interrupted the front desk clerk doing her nails ...", "The front desk staff, with one exception, were apathetic and disdainful.

Instead, the things that are important and mean a lot are things like making sure there's soap for the laundry, to be knowledgeable about and willing to recommend a nice local restaurant or two, to smile, to inquire if the guest needs anything, rather than just hanging around talking and (sigh) waiting until the guest inevitably and eventually finds his or way up to the counter to ask the question."]}, {"3a2cf509-0c74-488a-8866-9723e9d4c86b": ["2011-05-18 00:00:00", "2012-10-09 09:04:21", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "Really nice hotel", "Stayed because it was close to the airport!

We ended up going to Arden. During the day it sounds like there is constructuion going on above our room. At night you can hear people snoring next door... very annoying. And our air/heat unit kept shutting off so we woke up several times during the night to be serenaded by our neighbor snoring, who sounds like a freight train.

I also am pretty sure I didn't get the points for the green choice."]}, {"886d0a8d-0511-402f-a051-b2aa84feec9c": ["2013-01-25 00:00:00", "2013-01-27 04:19:04", 100, 20.0, null, "en", "****DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL-I AM WARNING YOU****", "I have never wanted or had to do a negative write-up on a hotel, but I feel it is my obligation to other future guests to let them know the real story at the FOUR POINTS SHERATON SACRAMENTO that I experienced last night.*Even with GPS, we got lost on the way to the hotel. So I called the front desk for directions (as we were within a half mile), and the person answering the phone from the hotel front desk you couldn't understand because their foreign accent was so thick. This person then passed the phone to their manager, and I could barely understand them, as well, with their thick accent. I live in diverse California and have friends from all countries around the world, and their accents at the front desk of this hotel were so thick you could not understand them on the phone.*I requested a King-sized bed, and they told me they only had double beds \"because they were 100% full\" which later you will see was not the truth, when you read the rest of this review. I'm 6 foot 2 inches, so this was extremely uncomfortable.....but I kept a great attitude and joked lovingly with the staff as we completed check-in.*The front desk lady's baby kept screaming during check-in, but I didn't mind I told her, because I have a five month old baby at home (thought I was going to get a break from that crying for one day though, on this trip, but it still was OK).*I then went up to the room, and the first thought was \"this is a Sheraton\"? I have stayed at over a thousand hotels, 2 star to 5 diamond, all over the world, and the first thought was this is barely better than a Motel Six, and reminded me a lot of my college dorm. But I was still OK with everything at this point, because I am easy going, and was tired and just wanted to go to sleep.*I walked into the bathroom, and the first thing I see, is a soiled with crap, one foot long piece of toilet paper hanging off the toilet seat. I have never seen that at any of the thousand rooms I have visited. I was still not upset, and laughed it off because I am easy going. I just wanted to go to sleep because I just came back from the Sacramento Kings basketball game entertaining a customer in our corporate suite, and was very tired.*I then go to shut the shades, so that I can sleep in until 7:30am in order to avoid the sun coming in the morning, and they would not pull down and shut (and I work out with weights in the gym at least four times a week). I am still not upset, but I was now starting to think about the movie, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles....and laughing to myself.*I then went to put on the TV, because I sleep best when it is on with the volume on lightly. I noticed right away that my finger was sticking to the remote. It was a white sticky substance, God only knows what that was. So I wiped it off, and went to tuck myself in.*While tucking myself in, I quickly realized that the sheet was too short and my feet were on the scratchy blanket. All I could think of were all of the bed bug stories I had been reading about in hotels. And after the sticky stuff on the remote, I was now starting to get a little upset. But I was tired, so I just tried to fall asleep.*I thought all of it was over, then I started to hear weird noises, over the sound of the TV in the next room, and it was about midnight. At first I heard a lady giggling loudly, and then I heard what sounded like three different male voices. I thought it was funny at first, but it never ended. I heard spanking, moaning (mostly from the female and not the three males), and what sounded like furniture being thrown into the wall for about an hour. I finally had enough and called the front desk and told them to please try to stop it. After about a half hour it continued, I got dressed, gathered all my stuff and headed out the room. On the way out, I saw a security guard that timidly said he was trying to get them to open the door for about 20 minutes, and they would not open it. I kept walking and went to the front desk, and told them I needed another room. I told them everything I had experienced, and they didn't say a word, not even an apology. I grabbed the new room key (I thought they said they were 100% full when I checked in), but they gave me three rooms to choose from now. I now thought I was going to sleep finally, but I quickly realized that I coul hear everyone walking down the hallway loudly in the new room and never did sleep. I gave up, packed up my stuff and called Southwest Airlines to get an early flight out. I will say that they did call the hotel airport van for me on the way out to their credit.If you do not believe me, then don't.....but this is the honest truth. I do not have time to write these stories as I am extremely busy, but I felt it was my obligation to all travelers to write this. The people of Sacramento are generally extremely nice, and hospitable, so this is no knock on the people of this city at all. I would highly recommend that if you are traveling with children to use your best judgement, if you want to book a room here, as I certainly would not want my family to have to endure this adventure. Overall, the Sheraton is a fantastic chain, and I will most likely reach out to their Executive Management next week, so they can hopefully coach the team at the Four Points Sheraton into the right direction so this experience does not happen again.Best regards and Good night."]}, {"6b8b8284-39c6-4755-9fc4-c3e3ad3efc5c": ["2013-01-01 00:00:00", "2013-01-24 05:12:13", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "Service", "Service was great, room was clean, food was good."]}, {"6b8dd8c5-8d23-44c7-97e3-31c8df4f5abd": ["2013-03-11 00:00:00", "2013-03-14 06:34:41", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "This hotel has been planned with guest needs, expectations and desires in mind.", "We found this hotel to be very strategically located near the airport and major freeways.

During our stay a big wedding party took place, but because the event center/ballroom is located in a separate building there was no additional noise. Inside the rooms we noticed that there is still not enough space for hanging your clothes. The free standing closet is nicely designed but not practical at all. Also: One side of the king size bed was either broken or sagging and very uncomfortable to sleep on (Room 425). Otherwise the hotel is in good shape, clean, and well taken care of.

Granted my stay was only 9 hours, most of which was sleeping (or attempting to), it was still enough time to gain a little insight of the facility. If I was scheduled for a second night, it would not have happened. I would have moved to another hotel.Driving from the airport is just a little tricky. When you get off the highway, you can see the hotel to your right (at about 1-oclock) as you exit and the road veers to the right and leads past the hotel, now on your left. Go to the light just past the hotel, make a left and stay in the left lane. There is a left turn lane immediately after you make the turn. Make a left just past the hotel on the road that runs adjacent to the hotel, and then make a left into the parking lot. You are basically circumventing the hotel in a counterclockwise fashion.Check-in was speedy, the two ladies were very pleasant and upgraded me to a suite. The suite was two rooms, handicap accessible, with the living room containing a couch (probably a pull out bed), a chair, table, another table for luggage and a desk. The bedroom contained king sized bed and night tables.Overall the quality and condition of the furniture was fair, faded, and I would question its comfort. There were many holes in the walls where former framed pieces must have hung, other items that were formerly hanging on the walls were pulled away, the lamps were about to fall apart, I was almost afraid to turn them on for fear the lamp would fall apart and the bulb on the desk lamp had pulled away from its base and was dangling.There were plenty of outlets at the desk, a good thing. WiFi was pretty quick.The bed OK but the blankets were borderline blech. Stains from previous occupants. The noise level from the adjoining streets is pretty loud, there seem to be an abundance of motorcycles and trucks going by. Don't expect a good night's sleep.The bath is basic with toiletries. The towels are not hung but in a basket on the floor. I find that somewhat disgusting, but since almost everything on the walls seems to fall down, might be the only option. The towels were very low quality, thin and might have been fitness center rejects.Check out was speedy and coffee is offered in the lobby.The overall condition of this hotel was less than acceptable for a Starwoods property. A good amount of TLC is required. The place is just plain haggard. If I were blindfolded and taken to the room, I would have guessed a Motel 6 or another side of the Interstate motel."]}, {"f53992f0-81c9-4e3e-83f9-91a790c3d18a": ["2013-03-01 00:00:00", "2013-03-24 06:14:38", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "Not appicable", "Very Good"]}, {"4ceb3cfc-bf0c-424f-9696-c43c82dabdd0": ["2013-02-02 00:00:00", "2013-05-09 08:38:43", 100, 60.0, null, "en", "OK for one night", "There was a lamp in the room that was broken and propped up against the wall.

I advised we had permission to bring our trailer, but he said we had to move it or he was going to charge us $50 for parking.

The water wasn't hot enough, so the bath was cold after sitting in it for 5 min. The internet was free but so slow it was useless. The gym is tiny. The pool was freezing and unusable. The most annoying thing came after checkout. My mother left her pillow in the room when we left. We called and after being asked 37 questions to verify the reservation and to identify the pillow, I was told that the staff would check with housekeeping and call me back. After no call back, I called again and was told that nothing was found. Again, I was asked quite a few questions about the type, size, and color of pillow. The hotel's pillows are all the same. If there is one that doesn't belong, obviously that is our pillow. Eventually, I was called and told the pillow and a book were both found in the room. Luckily we were still in the area. Upon arrival, only 20 minutes after the hotel confirmed that they had found the pillow and book, I was again asked quite a few questions to verify my reservation. Then, unbelievably, I was asked to go out to the car to get ID to pick up a pillow and book! If it were a watch, pair of earrings, wedding ring, laptop, or something of real value, I would have been happy to do so. But it seems a little extreme to grill the guest both on the phone and then in person only to force them to show ID for a used pillow and book. As a Starwood Gold member, I expect a little common sense to be used when trying to protect the guests.

The rooms are huge, so certainly no complaints there. The location is okay, but I am not sure how this qualifies as an airport hotel. It certainly isn't right at the airport.The internet is free, which is appreciated, but it is so slow it is useless. The auto setting on the heating system in the room didn't work, so the room was either too hot or to cold the entire stay. The pool was freezing! Not sure if heating was broken or if they just didn't bother to turn on. Gym is small and not very impressive. Rooms are overpriced for offering. The hot water in the room is not hot enough so the bath gets cold in 5 minutes even when filled with the hottest water available.The thing that upset me the most occurred after checkout. My mother left her pillow in the room as she always travels with her own pillow. We called a while after checkout to see if it had been found. I was asked quite a lot of questions to both verify my identity as well as help identify the pillow for them. There are 8 pillows in the room. If there are 9, obviously one is ours. I was told that the front desk would check with housekeeping and call me back with an answer. After not hearing anything for quite some time, I called again. I was told that nothing was found in the room and again asked 19 questions about the size, color, and type of pillow. I explained that we didn't have the pillow, so it must have been in the room. A short time later, I was called and told that both the pillow and my mother's book had both been found in the room. A miracle!What bothered me the most was that after we were told the pillow wasn't in the room, after driving back to the hotel to pick it up, they made me go back out to my car to get ID to pick up a left pillow and book. I had just had surgery which is why I was staying in the hotel. Walking out to the car and back was not something that came easily. We weren't picking up a wedding ring, a pair of earrings, a wallet, or anything else of any particular value. I understand not wanting to give something to the wrong person, but common sense needs to be applied. Who else would know that a pillow and book were there? I told them I would be there 20 min after we spoke on the phone. I verified the checkin and checkout date. As a Starwood gold member, I didn't expect this type of treatment picking up our property which we never would have gotten if we hadn't been persistent following up! The front desk staff needs to use a little better judgment with their guests."]}, {"8cd82f80-a99c-4da2-828d-35e899a9fe41": ["2013-10-01 00:00:00", "2013-11-03 14:28:17", 100, 100.0, null, "en", "Great Hotel", "The location near the airport was great, but getting to the entrance of the hotel took some u turns.

There were a bunch of \"little things\" that i noticed that added up to a lot in my opinion. I arrived late after 10pm. Front desk clerk was fairly rude and seemed \"asleep at the wheel.\" Clerk did not offer a greeting, gave me gold member room card, I booked a rate which included breakfast, but had to ask twice to get the coupon.TV in room didn't work, told upon checkout & they could careless.Hotel shuttle in the morning was an issue. I arrived early in lobby to check out at 10:50am. Shuttle is suppose to run every 30 mins on the hour. Myself and another hotel guest were politely & patiently waiting for the shuttle. I stepped outside at 5 mins till. No shuttle at 11. Minutes rolled by. The other guest was as frustrated as i was and went to ask about the shuttle. The maintenance man (i believe) hopped in to drive us at 21 mins past. He said absolutely nothing. I also noticed that both shuttle drivers to and from airport used their cellphones while driving. I believe its against the law in CA and if not, bad policy without a doubt. Upon my arrival at the airport I discovered I had left behind a $20 pen & promptly called the hotel. They could care less. Didn't return my call after 1st call to clerk after said shed call back in 10 mins, never did. When I called back an hour later while on the plane fixing to leave, she told me nothing was left in room. The only good thing was that the breakfast was not bad, fairly good actually!

They offer parking and an airport shuttle, but there was only a slight cost savings versus the $10/day economy parking at the airport, so we decided just to park at the airport, which allowed us to leave the hotel on our own schedule rather than waiting for the shuttle. We had an early Monday a.m. flight, and we wanted to check in early to get some sleep before our long day of travel. We checked in on a Sunday and early check-in was no problem. The place wasn't very busy. They evidently get a lot of business travellers, and we stayed there during a holiday, when there weren't many folks travelling on business. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, although they only had a shower in the room - no bathtub. The room decor was odd, kind of an industrial theme, but it worked. There is a small restaurant and bar off the lobby. The bar was well-stocked, and the bartender was efficient and friendly. We had a light dinner at the bar. Dinner was unexceptional; I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. But it was convenient. The hotel is a short distance from I-5, and it was quiet.

Stayed here in July 2014 for a business trip. I didn't choose this place; it was chosen for me, and I stayed here one night. They offer a free airport shuttle, which was appreciated, but when the guy came to pick me up he stopped in the middle of the lane, in the third lane from the curb, and it seemed to me he expected me to board the shuttle right there. He didn't get out to take the bags, and he parked so that the side door was blocked by a plastic traffic cone that they put between the lanes to keep cars from passing. Not the end of the world, but typical of this hotel, which someone described to me as more of a family business than a Starwood property. (I very much doubt that this was the driver's first trip out to the airport, so it's not like he didn't know where the passengers come out from the baggage claim.) After my stay there I found this description seemed to fit. Regarding the rooms, they are nothing special. Mine appeared to be pretty clean, but with little things here and there, like the top off a plastic soda bottle laying beside a piece of furniture, broken plastic vanes from the desk lying on the floor, and so forth. The worst part of my stay was the poorly insulated walls between the rooms, which meant I could hear the guy next door pretty well, when he coughed, snored, and so forth. Someone I talked to who stayed here at the same time said she awoke to the sound of her next-door-neighbor's cell phone alarm, which was consistent with my experience. The rooms are very basic, with no refrigerator and room unit air conditioners (they work, but they are loud, though it is true I'd rather listen to an A/C unit than a snoring neighbor). I could go on, but many other reviews on this site are saying the same things about this hotel, and express what it is like to stay at this property well enough. I notice that it's common to see the managers respond to reviews that are less than totally positive with apologies and promises to correct this and that, but one might think that if they were really addressing these complaints, the complaints would stop, or change."]}, {"b5392135-6135-4a45-b7d8-5c4463e7739e": ["2014-08-19 00:00:00", "2014-08-20 07:29:46", 100, 40.0, null, "en", "Terrible experience.

And this was in about 100'F plus heat by the way. Given a $600 room-rate for 2nights pre-paid, we were expecting more. Check-in desk girls: first one, some sort of intern/trainee, second one not sure if she was experienced but there was an English language barrier. We had a suite booked. We were told an existing guest had refused to leave and wanted to extend his stay so there were no suites available. We were informed we would have to take a standard double room. To qualify, we were not just being snooty about the suite. We have a very active one year old and she feels too enclosed in small hotel rooms, so we required the extra space. I ask for the manager who shows up, already looking defensive. Her name was Giggi Shahi, in case any of you have the displeasure. So, Sheraton Joke part one: \"We can offer you breakfast vouchers.\" My face says it all... Sheraton Joke part two: \"You can have 40% off the standard room rate.\" How does that solve my space issue? Finally they offer 2 adjoining rooms for the price of one. This is a non-ideal, but satisfactory solution given that we were attending a wedding reception at this hotel. Bearing in mind I've paid for a suite non-refundable upfront, I make a mental note that I will deal with the bill at the end. .... Oh and apparently California state law prevents the hotel from insisting a guest leaves when rooms are sold out. Really? Nice law for customers arriving. Weird, seriously. So anyway, we had a two night stay at this shoddy hotel, slow service everywhere, breakfast was like something provided at my kids nursery and room service was not even 24hours. To top it all off, the room had no mini-fridge in the room as we had explicitly requested of the reservation, for my wifes insulin! Although one was provided afterwards. And also, with the aforementioned heat in the Sacremento summer, this place is inexplicably stingy with room water bottles! The fact that they provide cheap Dasani (bottled tap water), this is quite remarkable. Fast forward to check out. Again, zero luggage assistance aside from a cart dropped off outside the room door. So we head down to reception, huge luggage cart in tow. The same two incompetents at the desk. I ask what they are doing about my bill since they owe me money (roughly half what I pre-paid). Front desk pair look like I have asked them to solve the theory of relativity, while simultaneously patting their head and rubbing their belly... No sign of the manager this time. I ask for her to call me as soon as possible to organise my refund. I have not heard a peep from these people since, despite calling the hotel again from home and still not being able to speak to this \"manager\".

However, when we walked into the room we noticed that the room had two double beds and was not we had paid for. So we brought our luggage back downstairs and told them that they gave us a room with two double beds and we paid for a king. The night desk clerk, Vinod, was very rude. He proceeded to tell us that they did not have any rooms with king beds and if we did not like it we could leave. We asked him why he did not tell us when we checked in (seeing that we paid for a king room) that there were none available. He once again told us if we did not like it we could leave. However, he knew he had us between a rock and hard place. We could not leave because we let him know that were dropped off at the hotel and did not have transportation. Also, we already had paid for the room. Unfortunately, we were stuck and it was late at night. We went to the room and called Priceline and asked what was going on and they said that the hotel did not close out the inventory through their system. Thus, Priceline was not aware that the room we ordered was no longer available. But wait there's more. We tried to use the internet but the connection was not working. So we called the front desk and asked for help and guess who we spoke to-Vinod. He gave us a 800 number to call. Not helpful! We called the Sheraton customer line to speak to someone about the horrible service we had received. The next day the general manager did give us a call and we explained the situation to her and she did apologize. We also met her before checking out and she apologized in person. She gave us a complimentary night at the hotel for our next visit which was a nice gesture. But we do not live in CA and would not be back in time before it expired.

I had a late flight in and let the front desk know that when I reserved. My flight was delayed so it would be after midnight. I called them to alert them and they said call for shuttle when you land. When I called he said they didn't have a driver at that moment but that he had to send a taxi (cost to be taken care of by hotel) which only took few minutes. I was fine that. It was a quick ride to the hotel. Check in was very quick and the desk clerk was nice and cordial, answered all my questions. I was on the fourth floor and I asked if it was quiet. He said yes and that is the floor that SPG members stay. I got to the room and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. It was very clean and well kept. Bathroom was big, bright and the tub was very clean. I hate going in to a hotel and seeing the caulk around the tub with mildew and yellowed. This was just the opposite. The bed was super comfortable. I was only going to get a few hours sleep before I flew out again so I needed that! I loved that the A/C was a wall unit. I need the fan noise to sleep and I got that! It was awesome! I did not hear any noise from other rooms and have no idea if they heard me. I was right by the elevator which concerned me but did not hear it all even in the morning. I was going to eat in the lobby but it looked like your normal food you would get at a hotel that had complimentary breakfast except they charged $11.00. I thought that was a little pricey so I checked out the little area in the lobby where you can buy snacks, etc. I got a small muffin, a bowl of Total Raisin Bran, and a cup of milk for $5.00! Just what I wanted anyway, and the milk was fresh as well. As for the shuttle, I would recommend asking at the front desk at check in to make sure you leave early enough. I was early but if you have other people being dropped off at another terminal they have to go all the way around the airport to do that which takes time. At least that's what they did with me.

The rest is specific to this Sheraton: Had to request light bulbs that were burned out be replaced; TV remote didn't work, had to get that replaced. The mattress pad was annoying, it bunched up constantly because it wasn't strapped down, but floated on top of the mattress. Wi-Fi was AWFUL!! Had to stand outside my room to load a page! Walls must be thin because I heard the neighbors TV, and work activities in the 'Mechanical Room' next door (which included stuff hitting & banging on the wall), and employees conversations while they were in there(why put employee lounges & mechanical rooms next to guest rooms anyway?). Could hear the guests in the room above me walking around. When checking in, the employee typed my card number in wrong(they don't swipe it) & I was told my card was declined. Instead of trying again, I was basically excused so the next person could be helped. (After driving across the country, seeing my oldest child off to the military, & having no vehicle during my stay there, it's the last way you want to be treated). The desk personnel was indifferent & acted as though it couldn't possibly be because she typed the card in wrong. The next day, when (trying) to ask the front desk staff for a suggestion on ordering food from nearby(as I had no vehicle & had never been to Sacramento) I was treated by one of them as though I was seriously interrupting their chat about something r/t the computer at the front desk. Not very helpful, not even interested in being helpful. My room was also across from the employee lounge & a few doors down from the side entrance of the hotel used by employees.

The walls are also poorly insulated for sound.  We could hear the tv in the next room pretty clearly.  It's obvious to me Sheraton didn't invest much in this line of their hotel chain.

The members of the group would use the security latch on their doors to keep them open and were going back and forth between the rooms.  Needless to say, this was very noisy.  After a couple hours of this, I did not see an end to the noise and asked the front-desk person on my way to dinner if it would be possible to change rooms.  I was relieved when the very understanding staff member was able to get my room moved to the other side of the elevator, far away from the noisy group.

It was quiet, seemed cleaner, had more towels and I had two of the best nights of sleep in a hotel that I have had in a long time.

When completed through the SPG app she realized she had made a mistake and booked the room for the next day not for the same day arrival we had intended to book. This was an honest mistake on our part and at no time did we try to blame anyone else, we were just hoping to get our money credited towards our intended stay, and when we immediately looked the rates were still identical for the day we wanted to stay and the one day different we accidently booked. I have stayed at many SPG properties for both business and pleasure and have always enjoyed excellent customer service, hence I booked directly with them to avoid the pitfalls of dealing with third party booking sites. Immediately upon realizing our minor honest mistake we pulled over and called the SPG 800 line, the very nice reservation agent took pity to our situation and stated that in cases like this they normally would reach out to the property manager and request the monies be applied to the correct date, and that except in rare cases the properties have no issue in doing this especially when the rates are identical. Given that we were due to arrive at the hotel within 30 minutes the SPG agent suggested going straight to the hotel and explain the situation to the shift manager as the property ultimately has the discretion. Upon arrival I was met with the exact opposite demeanor the front desk clerk told me that there was nothing they could do since I booked with a third party and I could pay the walk in rate and lose the money already paid or I could go elsewhere. I again explained I booked with SPG and NOT a 3rd party and that SPG stated the hotel had all discretion, the \"shift/sales manager\" finally came out of a backroom and apologized and said she did not know why the SPG 800 line \"lied\" to me. I immediately called SPG again while standing in the lobby. The agent on the phone was yet again excellent with her customer service and apologized that I was getting the run around by one of their properties. After almost an hour on the phone with SPG, the agent apologetically stated she had educated the hotel on SPG corporate policy and that the shift manager would be out to speak with me shortly and if I had any more problems to call SPG again. After 15 minutes the \"shift manager\" called me , and did not bother to come back out from her office during this phone call she essentially made me feel like a criminal and that SPG was forcing her to refund the amount we had already paid ($107) and that if we wanted to stay we could pay her special walkin rate of $129 plus tax or I could go elsewhere with my refund. Despite having my tablet in had that still showed the rate was $94 for the exact stay I was tired of arguing and being belittled by the staff alas I paid the $129 rate which with tax is now close to $150. \n\nTo add insult to injury while finally being checked in, the front desk advised breakfast this morning was included in the lobby. Well, I just returned from the lobby and when I asked the desk about breakfast, she snobbishly looked at me and said oh no, that's not included for you - you made that up and you were lucky to even get a room. \n\nSPG corporate was excellent and completely understanding during this nightmare, the Four Points SMF was completely lacking and disappointing. I never once tried to blame anyone else for our mistake but the hotel itself made no effort to understand or take action, just kept falling back on the you booked with a 3rd party there's nothing we can do, apparently this Four Points considers their corporate branding with SPG as a third party and don't honor that most important relationship. I haven't and didn't expect any compensation or anything for free just the room we wanted at the advertised rate and some basic customer service and if you offer breakfast to not recind that offer because I contacted your corporate office to make you honor your relationship.\n\nBottom line an utter disappointment, waste of time and insulting experience!"]}, {"59cd2fda-97a7-4317-93e4-e4af413c2255": ["2016-06-01 00:00:00", "2016-06-06 17:03:30", 100, 80.0, null, "en", "Clean and easy access from freeway", "TV did not work and night staff unable to fix it.

I told him and the nite manager that the hotel is responsible and would have to replace the items. He wasted no time in telling me NO! The hotel will not replace anything!

Room was clean and ready when I arrived.  I have stayed here about 6 times in the past without problems.  Perhaps I have been here when business was slow.  I never had problems with next door noise before.\n\nThis time, my neighbors on both sides decided to use their televisions at the same time.  I could have heard either one very easily if there were only one tv on.  However, with both tvs going, one tv drowned out the other.  This made it very difficult to sleep until both of my neighbors were asleep.\n\nI have never had that problem at this hotel.  Of course, it is possible that on earlier trips no one had been booked in the rooms next to mine.  Better insulation is needed for all three of these rooms, not just the two rooms with the adjoining door.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting problem was that I left my cell phone at home in Southern California.  I followed the instructions on the hotel phone to call home long distance.  The phone repeatedly beeped and refused to take all 11 numbers.  After numerous attempts, I  called downstairs to find out how the phones REALLY worked.  I was told by the receptionist that she did not know.  \n\nI was put on hold for ten minutes.

She said she would have a technician come to my room immediately to see about the problem.  About 45 minutes later, a \"technician\" came to room, read the instructions on the phones, and attempted to make a phone call from each of the hotel phones.

I was never able to make a phone call.\n\nMy experience had taught me to always make sure I have a cell phone with me.  What does Four Points take away from this:\n\n1.  The instructions for use of an in-room phone should be accurate.\n\n2. Your employees should know whether the phone instructions are accurate.\n\n3.  The employees should be able to fix the phones.\n\n4.

My fianc\u00e9 and I booked this hotel 6 weeks in advance, and were charged for the room several days before our wedding day.  We were looking forward to having somewhere to stay and relax on our wedding night before we left on the honeymoon out of SMF.  Knowing that our wedding was not going to be over until 10pm and it is roughly a 1 hour drive to the hotel we called the day before to make sure that late check in was allowed andwe were assured that everything would be okay.  Cut too two exhausted newlyweds who just got done with one of the most exciting/tiring days of there lives.  We show up to the hotel lobby suit cases in had, you could only imagine how happy we were.  We were greeted by the front desk clerk whom proceeded with the check in.  Nearly 30 seconds into the process we were informed that they had over booked the hotel and there were no rooms for us (which we had already paid for).  We were not offered any help in finding a place to stay and were told directly \"everything around us is booked, it's not our fault\".  I was in disbelief in how Unapologetic and unhelpful the hotel was. Nothing like being stranded in the airport for 6 hours on your wedding night.  To top it off it took 5 days and 7 phone calls before we got a generic email stating \"thank you for staying with us\" and a refund which could take a week.  Not one time did we receive a phone call or any kind of acceptance of fault.  In conclusion, there are only two reasons to book this hotel.  Number one, you like to gamble (on wether or not you are actually going to have a room).  Or two, you are looking for an adventure (trying to figure out what to do when they let you down, I cannot recommend sleeping on the floor of the airport).

It had high points and low points.\n\nThe GOOD:     Nice new building, large clean rooms, free airport shuttle, bar/food on premises.\n\nThe BAD:      \n1.)The bed itself was old/saggy/uncomfortable.   The 'bedding' (sheets, duvet, etc) was high-end, but this was a clearly old and saggy mattress, to the point where my back hurt in the morning.  It is puzzling that a Sheraton brand, at this high of a price point, would allow this bed in a room (room 228, if that matters).\n\n2.) Service at the front desk was very disappointing.    At check-in, I noticed my corp travel agent booked the room at the 'full rack rate' (well over two-hundred per night).  I asked for the AAA rate, and handed my AAA card to the check-in guy.   He punched some computer keys, handed my card back, and said \"you're all set\".     It is my mistake that I did not ask to initial a documented room rate at that point.   At checkout, I showed the bill (slid under my door, still at the full rack-rate) to the desk agent, and asked her to correct it to reflect the AAA rate.  She advised that it was already closed, and that I should call 'accounting' after 9AM.   I called them that day, left a detailed voicemail, including my AAA number and my phone and email (asking for a corrected receipt).   Nothing.   I called again this Monday, same thing.   Nothing, no response whatsoever. \n\nConclusion - this property has good potential, but at this high of a price point I would not stay here again, nor recommend it to business travelers.   If you stay here - Make absolutely sure you initial/approve of your room rate, at check in.    Upon entering your room, 'check out' the bed and if it is poor quality then consider asking for a different room."]}, {"503645a4-1eec-4e60-94ba-46d080a3241a": ["2017-06-06 00:00:00", "2018-08-19 08:35:13", 100, 40.0, null, "en", "Not very forgiving", "I made my reservation for a day later by accident.

At this point I had been trying to get in contact for over a week, so I called SPG customer service to see if they could help (I am SPG Gold). Over several days various SPG reps tried to contact the hotel requesting the manager to call me with still no luck. Finally this got escalated within SPG to the supervisor level, after nearly 2.5 weeks of getting the hotel to contact me, I finally talked to someone on property. I was astonished to find that after all this, the property was completely unsympathetic to the fact my flight had been cancelled due to the hurricane and maintained with the room charge. \n\nAfter getting a hold of SPG Customer Service to inform them the hotel isn't going to reverse the charge, they escalated the case even further but the hotel would not budge. Every SPG rep said they were shocked the hotel was being so greedy and unsympathetic to my situation and tried to get the hotel to change course unfortunately with no avail. \n\nLong story short: Flight cancelled due to hurricane, hotel refused to waive cancellation charge due to natural disaster, took nearly 3 weeks to get hotel to call me back, needed to get escalation with SPG to get any kind of response from hotel. On average I stay in over 30 different hotels every year. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever come across with a property. I sympathize with anyone who has an issue with the management onsite as they are completely unresponsive and frankly do not care. IMO this property is a black mark on SPGs otherwise fine portfolio of properties."]}, {"fe1900d9-7900-4b67-8651-f92785a8ee2b": ["2017-08-24 00:00:00", "2018-08-19 08:35:13", 100, 40.0, null, "en", "Last Place after more than 100 nights in hotels this year so far", "After staying more than 100 nights in hotels this year, this property by far is at the bottom of the list.\nThe bed should be thrown out or donated to a prison for further punishment.\nThe chair should be dropped off at a homeless camp nearby and while your at it, please give them all your shower gel and shampoo, as this is so overpowering in perfume/cologne of someone's grandpa.\nRegarding the bed...

My advice is if the front desk experience starts off with attitude and ignorance, this is pretty much an indicator of the poor quality service you'll receive during the rest of your stay.

Simply, no, you can't check in because it's not 3:00.  The place is a ghost town.  So I said, OK, we'll go and find some place to have lunch.

The hotel is 5 miles from the airport and there is no traffic at midnight. It took 8 minutes to get back to the hotel. I HATE being lied to by those that are in the service industry. Just tell me the truth and we can move on. When I got to my room, my wife and I had two double beds (I reserved a king). I checked my hotels.com confirmation and it does say king OR two doubles. That was my fault for not seeing that part. In what world is 2 doubles a substitute for a king bed?  That is asinine. The room had a dirty washcloth laying on the floor next to the furniture under the tv and there was paint/wallpaper peeling off the wall in the bathroom. For $300/night, I expect a whole lot better. The next morning I check out a 4:31am and ask for the shuttle to the airport. I was told it already left.

I didn\u2019t expect grandeur or high level service at the Four Points but I expect my room to be ready and clean.\n\nI do not take leaving a one star review lightly as I run a high end vacation rental property and reviews are a properties bread and butter! However, my experience was such that I believe other guests need to be warned to find another property. \n\nFour Points are franchises and the Sheraton name is licensed. Apparently, the owners of the Sheraton brand name do not have high standards for their franchisees.\n\nWe arrived at midnight. Desk clerk saw us and never greeted us. He seemed to be frantically trying to get key cards made for a couple of ladies waiting for their room. I am assuming their room wasn\u2019t ready either. Read on...\n\nWhile waiting to be at least greeted I saw a piece of paper that this Four Points Sheraton forced you to sign. It basically said that we needed to be quiet. We were warned that if we weren\u2019t quiet we would be charged $250.00 to compensate other guests who would be disturbed. I have been traveling for over 35 years and have never been required to sign such a document!  This screams scam to me and thinking back I should have never signed that. I will be looking at my credit card very carefully for charges.  We were just so tired.\n\nI am finally greeted and told, at midnight my room isn\u2019t ready. I am offered a King with a pullout instead. We are two single ladies traveling. That is not what I booked. I told the clerk no and he said they could make up the room in 15 minutes.\n\nAm I the only one this gives the creeps. I run a hospitality business. You can\u2019t sufficiently clean and sanitize a room in 15 minutes. ICK!!  We looked online there was no room availability in the area. I called Booking.com they didn\u2019t offer any help. \n\nWe got our room key and checked the room.  It appears the linens had been changed. However, the mattress pads had human hair all over them. Yes...we stripped the beds. The bath vanity hadn\u2019t been wiped down, there was hair on the floor and the toilet was dirty inside.\n\nSince we needed sleep we stayed.  However, if this is normal practice and I believe it is based on complaints to consumer groups online, this hotel will soon have issues with creepy crawly guests and bacterial growth.\n\nThis one property and their lack of hospitality skills, ability to turn their rooms efficiently, and lack of cleanliness ruined the Four Points Sheraton brand for me. I  am sure there are franchisees who run a successful business but if the brand isn\u2019t making sure their name is being held up to Sheraton  standards then I will never return to this brand."]}, {"42cec62c-7c7e-4962-b136-2471644c1e5a": ["2017-12-15 00:00:00", "2018-08-19 08:35:13", 100, 60.0, null, "en", "Not the best", "I'm SPG Gold.

On the plus side, the place is clean, rooms spacious, beds comfortable, linens updated, and the lobby bar/bar food/breakfast facility is adequate. On the other hand, the facility appears sterile, primarily due to choice of colors and lighting. Our room was entirely done in arctic white, except for brown carpet, with cold white fluorescent lighting throughout. Warm white lighting doesn't cost any more. Had a ridiculous issue with the check in clerk and ultimately with the hotel manager over a shuttle ride back from the airport. I ultimately prevailed, but the whole incident created ill will with me the guest. I had another issue for which the check in person promised to review with the manager and get back to me with the response. That never happened, and issue I raised was never resolved. Another silly rule they have is that for the typical uninspired breakfast, if you purchased a room that includes it, you both have to come together to be served and they prohibit taking any items back to the room. Finally, there are no provisions for a night light anywhere, and they have a timer switch on the bathroom light, so you can't even leave that on. On the bright side (literally), the drapes and blind are not effective in blocking out the parking lot lights, so the room has a dim glow all night. Airplane noise is noticeable until after midnight, when there are no flights. In summary, in my view, shortsighted decisions are being made by management that are harming the desirability of the hotel. If you don't need a hotel near the airport with shuttle service, you would be better off elsewhere."]}, {"e953fee2-6493-4245-990d-a33e1d697914": ["2017-10-12 00:00:00", "2018-08-19 08:35:13", 100, 60.0, null, "en", "Was okay, nice, and clean, has airport shuttle, but, won't stay again.", "Overall the hotel was okay.  As a person who stays in hotels approx. 90 nights a year, I get around. I had never stayed at a Four Points before, nor any Sheraton.  Usually I am with Hilton and Marriott (yes, I know Marriott now owns Sheraton).  \n\nUpon arrival in room I was quite pleased.  It was clean and fresh.  They make everyone sign a document which makes them very aware that they will be charged $200 if they smoke in the room. Seemed a bit of an overkill, but I have stayed in non-smoking rooms in the past at other places and you can tell at some point someone smoked in it.  So while a bit extreme, not really a big deal and the fresh room made up for it.\n\nWhy won't I stay here again:\n1) Very few power outlets.  Every receptacle had only one available outlet after a lamp was plugged in.  Had to plug laptop into wall near desk (no outlet on desk or desk lamp). Phone into outlet between beds, and iPad behind chair in corner.  It's been several years since I've run into so few outlets in a hotel room.\n\n2) Desk lamp has old fashioned switch in the power cord, so you have to reach for it.  Slightly inconvenient.   Not a big deal unless you need to turn it on in the middle of the night.\n\n3) The lamps for the beds are the push-type on/off switch mounted on the wall.  You really cannot reach them without practically climbing out of bed.  Since I am here for work, I often get calls at night, and this was annoying while trying to do it quickly and answer the phone at the same time.\n\n4) The TV is mounted in a fixed position,  It cannot be turned making it hard to see from work-desk.  \n\n5) The vanity is a cabinet with the hanger rack going from the wall towards you, which makes it hard to place shirts and pants because they are behind each other, instead of all visible next to each other and limited.  I had to dig behind all of the clamp-type hangers to get to a non-clamp-type hanger.\n\n6) They have an amazing 2-day cancellation policy.  Absurd at this level.  I had to change from three night's stay to one night at the last minute.  I called ahead to let them know.  They had to completely rebook the stay and naturally the price went up around $50.  Business travelers beware.\n\n7) The rooms are not as soundproof as most (or at least it seemed that way).  The sound here between rooms was like it usually is when there is an adjoining door.  There wasn't one in this room, so it surprised me a bit.  I am very aware that my neighbors were up before 5, and I am worried that they heard me on the phone late at night.\n\n8) No included breakfast.\n\nNothing here is \"major\" and, some trivial, and by themselves really not that much of a concern.  I wouldn't even bring these things up normally, but I feel if I am going to make a statement that I won't stay at a place again, I need to explain why.  When all added together it just boils down to \"why would I bother staying here?\"  I don't have any of these issues at the comparable hotels.\n\nI stayed here mainly because a college from another company had booked it and I wanted to be in the same hotel. In the future I will avoid four points hotels.  I don't know if they are all like this or not. But for me, when I travel routinely for work, above all else\nI value consistency.  So whether this hotel is not consistent with other four points, or they are all like this, either way, I won't be a four points guest again unless they are significantly lower in price than their peers."]}, {"ba4aca42-e60d-4e64-acae-a96a60e56193": ["2017-12-03 00:00:00", "2018-09-03 20:09:29", 100, 80.0, null, "en", null, "Nice hotel."]}, {"124d10c0-767a-4a31-8af1-06f24b9f5bf7": ["2017-12-28 00:00:00", "2018-08-28 02:12:41", 100, 60.0, null, "en", null, "It was a clean room.

On average I stay in over 30 different hotels every year. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever come across with a property. I sympathize with anyone who has an issue with the management onsite as they are completely unresponsive and frankly do not care. IMO this property is a black mark on SPGs otherwise fine portfolio of properties. I booked this hotel for a one-night stay in late August. On the day I was supposed to arrive, my flight was canceled due Hurricane Harvey wreaking havoc in Houston (I was flying to SMF from TX). I called the hotel once I found out my flight was cancelled and told them I was stuck in Texas because of the hurricane. They said they would notate that as my reason for cancelling. A few days later I was surprised to see a charge from the hotel for my room. Although I cancelled outside the cancellation window (a ridiculous 48 hrs prior to arrival) since it was due to a natural disaster I assumed they would waive the charge (as has happened when similar events happened in the past when staying at other properties). I called the hotel to try to talk to someone about this and left a message for the manager to call me back. 2 days later no call back, so I called again, left a message and waited. Still no response after another day. So I called a third time, left a message, waited and still no response. At this point I had been trying to get in contact for over a week, so I called SPG customer service to see if they could help (I am SPG Gold). Over several days various SPG reps tried to contact the hotel requesting the manager to call me with still no luck. Finally this got escalated within SPG to the supervisor level, after nearly 2.5 weeks of getting the hotel to contact me, I finally talked to someone on property.

Now, because of a medical situation, my husband and I have had to cancel our long awaited trip, as well as our overnight stay at the Four Points Sheraton before an early morning flight the next day.

The hotel has informed me that because we reserved at some sort of special rate, they cannot refund my money--they have already charged my credit card apparently. I asked if they could transfer that money to another reservation I need for October 15th. No, they cannot do that either. So I am out $138.67. I will contact another hotel for my October 15th reservation. I'm sure in the fine print there is some warning about this.

Within the SPG/Marriott brand(corp booking), my expectations are always: clean and safe.    My filters include: gym, business center with printer, near airport, airport shuttle, free parking,  complimentary park n fly, restaurant/lounge on premises, quiet between the rooms.    I have been pretty successful with hitting all of these in past choices with Four Points.  And, with my loyalty, they have extended way beyond my expectations with drink tokens, laundry service, free breakfast\u2026etc.\nUntil now.  I am newly assigned to Sacramento, and on paper, this hotel seemed to work.  But, I can say that I will NEVER stay here again.  Other than the nice respectful lounge/waiter and room clean staff, this property is a disaster.\nMade Corp Reservations (through SPG.com) for 2 rooms 3 nights each in January.  My co-worker was traveling with me. The day of travel, he had to cancel until the next day.  No problem\u2026I would take care of it at the hotel.\nAirport Shuttle:  I get to SMF, retrieve my bag, and call the hotel to confirm pickup area.  They had told me it runs every half hour (10 minute ride).  I called at 1:26.  I was put on hold for 5 minutes.  Then told that because I didn\u2019t call by 1:25, the shuttle is not coming!  I had to wait until the 2:00 pm shuttle.  Called Uber.\nHotel Check in:  I checked in, and advised the second room would not be checking in until the next day.  She advised they have a 48 hour cancellation, and I would be charged.   And, the room would have to be re-booked on a rate that was $60 higher per night!   But she would get permission to \u201clet\u201d me check into both rooms to keep reservations!!  I showed my corporate reservation, which clearly states I can cancel up to 6:00 pm day of travel with NO penalties.  \u201cThat is not our policy.\u201d   She completely disregarded the SPG guidelines for corp travel reservations.\nHotels were sold out in the area, so I checked into both rooms, so I didn\u2019t lose the reservation, and planned to challenge this with SPG.\nKeys:  Old key system\u2014 if your key even comes close to your cell phone. It deactivates.  Happened at least 2 times a day, as I drop everything in my purse.  Constant traffic to the front desk from many guests, while the staff was busy trying to explain to phone calls about the ridiculous 48 hour cancellation policy.\nGYM:  TVs on cardio don\u2019t work, no antibacterial wipes\nRoom noise:  I could hear the next room using the bathroom.  Thank goodness I was so high from the wafting MJ from below, I fell asleep.\nBusiness Center:  Out of Order\nCoffee:  I cannot think of any hotel that does not have coffee in the lobby 24 hours.  After work-out went over for a cup (there is a set up in the restaurant area) and asked for a cup.  Was advised \u201cmy rate does not include breakfast.\u201d  I didn\u2019t want breakfast, just a cup of coffee!\nSo, we stuck it out, and checked out after the 3 days.  Called SPG, who fought with them for over an hour, before hotel agreed to refund.  Left my car there for the weekend\u2026.but returned and couldn\u2019t stomach staying there again.\nReturned to this hotel 2 weeks later\u2026only because no credit yet, and mysterious $70 charge on my card.  Figured it was easier discussing while \u201cgiving them a second chance.\u201d\nStill no wipes in restaurant, no coffee in lobby, business center in-op\u2026same issues.  Felt like I had to start my \u201ccredit\u201d conversation all over, with 5 different people (manager is never available.) And, the $70 charge?  For 3 days of weekend parking!  As, \u201crate on the last stay was not park n fly.\u201d (Although I checked the rate, and I paid the same!!)  Noting all the construction trucks parked in the back lot, I asked one of the workers\u2026the lot is city property.  So they are \u201cselling\u201d city property for parking. Hmmmm.

But they have no problem at charging you and holding your money like the thieves they are. I called the police to help mediate and resolve the issue (I know it's not a criminal issue, but the police are still peace officers and are entrusted to help people when in trouble), but they had no respect for them and refused to work with them at all just saying the same thing \" there is no manager, sorry.\" The young lady at the front desk could only recommend calling back to speak with a manager. When I called the next day, after being put on hold, made to wait, transferred, I finally reached the \"manager\".

After waiting about 45min, I went to the front desk and asked for cleaning supplys to clean It myself. Which I did. Some Someone came to our room about an hour and a half after my  call to the front desk and said he was there to check my TV??!! The following morning I went to the lobby for the buffet breakfast. I planned to fix two small plates for my husband and I to eat in bed. However I was told by the young lady servicing the breakfast area \" I'm sorry you cain't eat in your room. As if I where a kid.  I'm PAYING $8 per person for our food. I was very irritated by this. the selection of breakfast items was not bad. When I asked  at the front desk if there was a manager there? The young lady said \"yes,  but what did you need\"? I said to speak with her.  I was told \"she was very busy and would call me later\". This was one of the WORST experiences I've ever encountered at a so called 4star hotel. Had we not pre-paid for two nights without a refund option,  I would have checked out on day one!!! And by the way, I never received that call from a manager. I would NEVER  Refer this particular hotel to anyone. Nore will I ever stay there again.  The professionalism of the staff was very hit and miss.  And I don't appreciate being treated as if I'm a Nuisance when I'm paying my hard earned money to stay at their hotel. The only good thing that came out of this hotel stay was,  spending some quality time with my husband. There 4 star hotel provided 2 star service.

Front desk guy finally let me check in after a 5 minute argument because my reservation was under \"Bill\" and the name on my credit card is \"William\". Dude literally thought I was lying about the fact that Bill is short for William and acted like I was trying to scam my way into an airport Four Points reservation with someone with the exact same last name as me (despite the fact that the card I was using was the same one I made the reservation with in the first place). After having to loudly tell him 5 minutes into the conversation after hearing that he would be able to let me check in \"IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GOOGLE IT, IT'S LIKE IF A DUDE NAMED ROBERT WAS CALLED BOB, IT'S THE SAME THING, Bill IS WILLIAM, DICK IS RICHARD, YOU'RE LITTERELLY KILLING ME BRO\" he finally broke and let me check in. To make matters more confusing (if that was possible), I had a return visit booked after my trip that I purchased the parking package for. I specifically checked prior to booking because I wanted to see if they'd let me have it end on that night of my second stay as opposed to the following 7 nights (which I didn't need since that was at the end of the trip and I get free parking at home). I was assured that this would not be a problem, they'd start it the night after I checked out (which would have been the 14th) and end on the 23rd, the day I was back. That's 11 nights of parking, minus 2 counting the nights I had a room booked and minus 7 to coincide with the package I purchased to make a difference of 2 nights at $10 per night, equaling $20. Front desk guy just couldn't wrap his head around this advanced math and his supervisor came out, said that they can't do that and it'd be $90. I informed her that I was specifically told by a woman the day before that they would have zero problems counting back from the second night stay (since I bookend the trip with two stays with them). Supervisor lady then said, \"that's impossible, we have a policy and the general manager would never allow this, you will have parking from the 23rd until the 31st\". I then responded with \"why would I need parking After my trip is over, I actually park at home, for free? I would have never booked a second night and purchased the parking package if I was told any different\". She didn't care, took my number and said the general manager would call me, I could talk it over with them and they'd charge me upon my return or after we spoke\". Realizing there's no reasoning with her since she clearly doesn't care, hates her job or just hates customers or has some type of complete aversion to customer service, I decided engaging any further wasn't worth the effort. At this point there was no way I was keeping that second night and I'd rather overpay at the airport as opposed giving these guys another nickel. I'd rather shut my hand in the car door for a week straight then stay there again. I checked the terms of the reservation and there was no prepayment cancelation penalty so I canceled and promptly booked another location, slept for 3 hours and then left to the airport and parked there. No general manager called that next day. I then noticed the following day that my Amex was charged $90 for parking AND the entire rate for the canceled night. I promptly called, told them no GM called me AND I actually decided to not park there after my annoyance at what occurred, she said she'd get the charges taken off and the GM would call me. GUESS WHAT? No call AND I've got two charges that have posted to my account that should not be there. Also, beds wildly uncomfortable. Elevator makes creaky noises and the place has a moldy oder in the rooms. I'd go with zero stars but it's not an option.

I called, was told they were on their way.  20 minutes later, standing in the cold, I tried to call to cancel the shuttle and just take an Uber/Taxi- but no one answered the phone, I called 3 times- no one answered.  Finally the shuttle arrives.  The hotel is only 5 minutes from the airport- the 20 minute wait in the cold when we had a scheduled time was not necessary.  Clearly someone did not leave to drive the 5 minutes when they told me he was on his way.\n\nCheck in- went quickly.  Lobby is small, old and run down.  \n\nI turned the corner to go the elevator.

Wait another 10 minutes, he finally arrives and switches out the batteries and leaves.\n\nI turn the tv on- none of the channels work- no signal.  I call downstairs again, very frustrated.  I'm told they will reset my system.  I'm told to turn it off and wait 2 minutes, try again.  I turn it off, I wait 10 minutes.  Still not working.  While waiting, I pull the sheets down on the bed to check them out- a long black hair is inside the covers.  The bedding is old and shabby.  Gross.  \n\nI turn off the tv and wait 10 more minutes.  Still not working.  I call again, they put me on hold for a full 5 minutes.  She says someone is coming up to take a look.  It takes another 10-15 minutes for them to come up to take a look and determine the tv is not working and I'll need to switch rooms.  \n\nBy now I am angry and tired and done with this whole situation and it's now nearly midnight- I have to be up at 4am to catch a flight.\n\nI say no, I do not want to switch rooms, I do not want stay here and I grab my bags and go down to the lobby.

I run through my entire experience with the front desk lady and tell her I am not at all happy with the hotel. I want to check out and they will not be charging me for the room.  She tells me she can check me out but she cannot remove card and cannot refund my money- only a manager can do this.  I said, Great- bring the manager out, I'd be happy to talk to them.  The manager is not there.  I said- so you are telling me a Sheraton hotel has no manager on duty or available to handle customer issues at all?  She said yes.  I said- call the manager then.  She tried calling them a couple times but could not get a hold of the manager.  Her man friend that she was flirting with as I walked up offers to pay for the room so I can leave.  I tell him, no- this is a Sheraton hotel, they should be able to either back up their product or refund unhappy customers.  I am not asking for something undue here.  I was very frustrated and very angry but I did not curse at her and I did not yell at her or make it personal.  I told her my complaints and what I wanted.  She had no ability to help me.\n\nEventually she found a way to check me out and not charge me and she promised me that she would have the manager call me in the morning before they charge my card.  I'm still awaiting that call and will escalate that issue as far as I need to.\n\nI called an Uber and went down to the Hilton Garden Inn- 5 minutes away, paid $10 more for the room and it was clean, comfortable, well maintained and great customer services.

The next thing was when I got to my room, one of the blankets looked like it had a dried up blood stain on it which was completely disgusting. Next the shower had like a green build up or some kind of residue of something surrounding the drain which is again nasty & scary! I spoke with a lady about changing rooms which she was very understanding & accommodated me & switched me rooms. This hotel was definitely a disappointment & I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The only good thing about this stay was the receptionist was very understanding & paid for my breakfast & the tv in the rooms where nice as well everything is was horrible!

(And because it had on-site bar and restaurant - which is why I picked it over nearby Hilton properties where I would normally stay).   It is less than 10 minutes from the airport.\n\nRestaurant and Bar:  Closed.  Was only told 'bartender didn't show up'.  Poor property management if that causes that kind of closure.  Apparently the bartender also served the food from the kitchen (which WAS open - but only for take-away).  Would have liked to know this earlier.\n\nRoom:  Looked new, no complaints.  Note they have now gone to refillable bottles for shampoo, conditioner, bath gel instead of the little bottles.  There was an individual bottle of lotion on the sink.  Room had coffee maker, mini-fridge, microwave, iron/board, hairdryer.  \n\nService: As far as I could see there were only 4 employees working yesterday - two at the front desk, the cook, and shuttle driver.  When I was checking in was told bar and restaurant were closed - but could buy stuff from the pantry including beer/wine.  And that you could order from kitchen, and food could be delivered.  Also shuttle driver could take to nearby restaurants.   I had work to do, and had planned at working in restaurant/bar area while eating.  Instead ordered at front desk, they said someone would deliver.  As it turned out, one of the desk staff brought my dinner, and the other brought the 2 beers I ordered a few minutes later. The front desk staff also helped with some other requests, and I have to say they were both very nice and helpful and by themselves took this review from a 3 to a 5. \n\nDate of stay was 5/29/2019.\n\nAdditional Tip:  If you are returning a rental car, there is a gas station just before the rental return at Sacramento airport.

The super cheap shampoo and body wash supplied thru a wall dispenser in the shower was so caustic it gave my wife a rash from using it. There was NO Kleenex anywhere.
