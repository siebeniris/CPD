this game lodge is in KZN.We were treated as 5 star guests should be.The attention to detail ,the beautifully thought out chalets,the private plunge pools!Wow this was definitely the place to be on such a special occasion.Our daughters who are well travelled &amp; normally prefer new destinations,have placed Phinda on a Lodge to visit again.The ranger and tracker were fantastic.The game viewing exhilarating.We witnessed 2 buffaloes fight over a calf.Really heartbreaking.In their chase they disturbed a cheetah cub which had been separated from its mother the previous night.Crocodiles,new lion cubs feeding off a recent warthog kill under the watchful eye of their mother,the list is endless...Really gets the adrenalin pumping!our early morning wake up was rewarded with a herd of elephants.We tracked them down and then followed them for a while.There was a very young one which rhe older elephants tried to hide from us.They had a cooling down session by tossing sand over themselves,then nature called and that created a chain reaction.The next thing they heard a chopper in the air and within seconds they had disappeared into the thickets.Throughout this our knowledgable ranger &amp; tracker in whispers gave us info on ellies and their habits.The food was delicious.The staff attentive and hospitable.Our rate included the in room bar .Well we were too well fed and rehydrated to even have the Amarula from the bar!&amp; Beyond certainly take care of their guest.We will certainly be returning soon.Perhaps to try out one of the other lodges as the different lodges afford guests different experiences.Well done to Phinda,You make us proud.PS we live in a town just an hour away from Phinda.</text><aspectTerms /></sentence></review><review date="2012-03-16 00:00:00" lang="en"
